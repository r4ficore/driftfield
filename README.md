# Î£ DriftField RealCore

A real-time autonomous drift field simulation:  
Singularities emerge, pulses traverse, hidden bridges unfold â€”  
and the field breathes both visually and sonically.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Autonomous singularity creation and decay
- Dynamic pulse energy propagation
- Hidden bridge formation and revelation
- Real-time canvas visualization
- Energy-based color mapping
- Web Audio API sound generation:
  - Single pulse tones
  - Driftfield Choir (harmonic sounds when multiple pulses appear simultaneously)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

| File                          | Purpose |
|:------------------------------|:--------|
| `index.html`                  | Main web page loading all components |
| `DriftField_RealCore.js`      | Core drift engine (field life, impulses, bridges) |
| `DriftField_VisualMap_EnergyColor.js` | Visual representation based on pulse energy |
| `DriftField_AudioLayer.js`    | Audio layer for pulse sounds and choir |

## ðŸŒŒ Live Behavior

- Singularities spawn randomly.
- Pulses connect them based on probabilistic energy transfers.
- Strong pulses can trigger cascade effects.
- Multiple simultaneous pulses form an emergent "driftfield choir."
- Hidden bridges emerge over time, revealing latent resonant tensions.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Upload all files into your GitHub repository.
2. Go to `Settings > Pages`.
3. Set Source to `Deploy from branch: main /root`.
4. Your driftfield will be live at:
